				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Most websites take approximately 6-12 weeks to complete.
					We have the capacity to do rush jobs for an additional fee. Your project manager will provide
					you with a project plan and important milestone dates.

				<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>HOW MUCH OF MY TIME WILL THIS TAKE UP?</u></b></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Your contribution to the website design process is very important but we also 
					want to be respectful of your time. Most of our clients spend about 2-4 hours per week working with us during the 
					duration of the project. This time includes the in-person (if possible) design meeting, review meetings, providing input, and receiving training.
