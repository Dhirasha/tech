				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> What good is a website if you can’t use it yourself? In the old days 
					of web development, any change to a website required a webmaster. Site owners had little to no ability to edit 
					their sites themselves. Today, we use Content Management Systems, such as WordPress, to put the power of site editing back in your hands.
					With WordPress, you’ll have the ability to add, edit, and remove pages, blog posts, comments, photos, videos, and more.
					No programming or expensive software is required, and changes you make to your site are instantly updated. WordPress 
					is extremely user-friendly for anyone. We like to say “If you can do it in Microsoft Word, you can do it in WordPress”.
				</font></p>
				
				<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>DO YOU USE TEMPLATED THEMES?</u></b></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Unlike many other WordPress designers we don’t use pre-built themes templates.
					Your business is unique and your website should be too! We create custom designed themes for each web project. 
					Pre-built themes do not easily scale up when a business adds a new service, line of business or product</font></p>
				
				<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>WILL I BE ABLE TO EDIT THE CONTENT MYSELF?</u></b></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Yes! We build websites on WordPress, a popular and easy-to-use content management system.
					With WordPress, you’ll have the ability to add, edit, and remove pages, blog posts, comments, photos, videos, and more.
					No programming or expensive software is required, and changes you make to your site are instantly updated. WordPress is 
					extremely user-friendly for anyone. We like to say “If you can do it in Microsoft Word, you can do it in WordPress”.
					control complex page layouts. Ask us for a demo to see how we’ve improved on WordPress’ incredible features.
