					<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>DO YOU OFFER WEBSITE HOSTING?</u></b></font>
					<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Yes! Computer Courage is proud to offer our own Managed WordPress Hosting. 
						Our hosting is fast, secure, always up-to-date, and worry-free. Read more at https://computercourage.com/hosting/
					</font></p>
					
					<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>WHAT DOES “MANAGED SOLUTION” MEAN IN TERMS OF HOSTING?</u></b></font>
					<p><font color="black"; size="4";> Our solution is a managed solution – we’ll take care of everything. 
						That means you have one source for hosting, support, performance, security, backups, and more. We’ll actively monitor
						your site for uptime (with reporting) and we’ll keep WordPress up to date so you don’t have to worry about (or pay for) 
						upgrades to stay secure and get new features. On top of that, we offer some of the most powerful and fast hosting on the market today.

					</font></p>
					
					<font size="4"; color="purple";><b><u>DO YOU REGISTER DOMAIN NAMES?</u></b></font>
					<p><font color="black"; size="4";>We believe that a domain name is an important asset for an organization which 
						should be fully under that organization’s control. Rather than reselling you a domain name, we’ll be more than happy 
						help you register your own domain name through a trusted vendor.
