			    <h3><u><font size="4"; color="purple";>HOW MUCH DOES A WEBSITE COST?</h3></u></font>
			    <p><font color="black"; size="4";>Every website project is unique. We offer a free service to create an estimated 
					scope of work and budget for potential projects. We help customers identify the important factors into cost, 
					such as design complexity, custom functionality, responsive design, and project management and training.
					After meeting with you to discuss your organization and website goals we will present you with a time and 
					materials proposal that includes a written scope of work and budget estimate for the entire site.s
			    </font></b></p>
				
				<h3><u><font size="4"; color="purple";> DO YOU OFFER FIXED PRICING?</h3></u></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";> We work exclusively on a time and materials model. We offer extremely careful 
					budgeting, time tracking, reporting, as well as “do not exceed” budgets. We pride ourselves in our unique ability 
					to accurately forecast and track costs, and deliver a final product that meets budget and scope estimates as closely as possible.
					With the time and materials model, you are put in the drivers seat for your budget. You are given opportunities before 
					and during the project to control and adjust the budget to meet your organization’s needs.
				</font></b></p>
				
				<font size="4"; color="purple";><b> <u> DO YOu REQUIRE A DEPOSIT ?</b></u></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";>Yes. A deposit of 25% of the estimated project total is required to initiate the project.
					We invoice monthly for work performed after the initial deposit is used, and require full payment before site launch.
				</font></b></p>
				
				<h3><u><font size="4"; color="purple";>WHAT TYPES OF PAYMENT DO YOU ACCEPT? </h3></u></font>
				<p><font color="black"; size="4";>We accept credit cards, checks and cash. We have an online payment system for one-time and recurring 	payments.
